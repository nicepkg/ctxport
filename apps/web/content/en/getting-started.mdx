# Getting Started

This guide walks you through installing CtxPort and copying your first AI conversation. Even if you've never installed a browser extension manually, you'll be up and running in under 2 minutes.

## Requirements

- **Google Chrome** version 88 or later (or any Chromium-based browser like Edge, Brave, Arc)
- A computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux

## Install CtxPort

CtxPort is not yet available on the Chrome Web Store. You can install it directly from GitHub.

### Step 1: Download

Go to the [CtxPort Releases](https://github.com/nicepkg/ctxport/releases) page on GitHub. Find the latest release and download the file named **`ctxport-chrome-mv3.zip`**.

### Step 2: Unzip

Locate the downloaded ZIP file on your computer and extract it. You should see a folder containing a `manifest.json` file — that's the extension.

### Step 3: Open Chrome Extensions

Open Chrome and type `chrome://extensions` in the address bar, then press Enter.

### Step 4: Enable Developer Mode

In the top-right corner of the extensions page, you'll see a **Developer mode** toggle. Turn it on.

### Step 5: Load the Extension

Click the **Load unpacked** button that appears in the top-left area. In the file picker, select the folder you extracted in Step 2 (the one containing `manifest.json`).

### Step 6: Done

CtxPort is now installed. You'll see its icon in your browser's extension toolbar. If the icon doesn't appear, click the puzzle piece icon in the toolbar and pin CtxPort.

## First Use

1. Open any supported platform — [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com), [Claude](https://claude.ai), [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com), or others
2. Start a new conversation or open an existing one
3. You'll see CtxPort's copy button appear near the conversation
4. Click the button — or press **Alt+Shift+C** — to copy the conversation
5. Open any text editor or note app and paste

You'll get clean, structured Markdown with a YAML frontmatter header and the full conversation content. See [Context Bundle](/docs/context-bundle) for details on the output format.

## Updating CtxPort

When a new version is released:

1. Download the new `ctxport-chrome-mv3.zip` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/nicepkg/ctxport/releases)
2. Unzip it to the same location (or a new folder)
3. Go to `chrome://extensions`
4. If you extracted to a new folder, remove the old extension and click **Load unpacked** again
5. If you extracted to the same folder, just click the **refresh** icon on the CtxPort extension card
