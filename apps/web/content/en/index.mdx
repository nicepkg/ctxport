# CtxPort Documentation

CtxPort is a browser extension that copies AI conversations as structured Markdown with one click. No data leaves your browser — everything is processed locally.

## What is CtxPort?

When you work with AI assistants like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini, your conversations contain valuable context — decisions, code, ideas, and reasoning. CtxPort captures that context as clean, structured Markdown you can paste anywhere.

- **One-click copy** from inside any supported AI chat
- **Sidebar copy** without even opening the conversation
- **Structured output** with YAML frontmatter and Markdown body
- **Multiple formats** — Full, User Only, Code Only, Compact
- **100% local** — zero data uploaded, ever

## Quick Start

1. Download `ctxport-chrome-mv3.zip` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/nicepkg/ctxport/releases)
2. Unzip and load it in `chrome://extensions` with Developer Mode on
3. Open any supported AI chat and click the copy button
4. Paste into your editor — structured Markdown, ready to go
