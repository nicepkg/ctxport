# Features

CtxPort gives you multiple ways to copy AI conversations, each designed for a different workflow.

## In-Chat Copy Button

When you open a conversation on any supported platform, CtxPort adds a copy button directly into the chat interface. Click it to copy the entire conversation as structured Markdown.

The button appears automatically — no configuration needed.

## Sidebar List Copy

This is CtxPort's standout feature. Hover over any conversation in the sidebar list, and a copy icon appears. Click it to copy that conversation **without opening it first**.

This is useful when you need to grab multiple conversations quickly or copy an older conversation without losing your current one.

Sidebar copy is currently supported on **ChatGPT** and **Claude**.

## Keyboard Shortcut

Press **Alt+Shift+C** to copy the current conversation instantly. No clicking needed.

You can customize this shortcut in Chrome — see [Keyboard Shortcuts](/docs/keyboard-shortcuts) for details.

## Copy Formats

CtxPort supports four output formats. Choose the one that fits your use case:

### Full

The default format. Copies the entire conversation including all user and assistant messages, with full Markdown formatting preserved.

Best for: archiving conversations, sharing complete context with teammates, feeding into other AI tools.

### User Only

Copies only the user's messages (your prompts). Assistant responses are excluded.

Best for: collecting your prompts for reuse, building prompt libraries, reviewing what you asked.

### Code Only

Extracts all code blocks from the conversation, preserving the original language tags (e.g., `python`, `typescript`, `sql`).

Best for: grabbing generated code, collecting snippets, code review.

### Compact

A compressed format that includes all messages but removes excessive whitespace and simplifies formatting.

Best for: quick sharing in chat apps, pasting into contexts with limited space.

## Context Menu

Right-click on any supported AI chat page to access CtxPort's copy options through the browser's context menu. This provides the same copy formats as the button.
