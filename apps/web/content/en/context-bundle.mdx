# Context Bundle

A Context Bundle is the structured Markdown format that CtxPort produces when you copy a conversation. It combines machine-readable metadata with human-readable content.

## Format Overview

Every Context Bundle has two parts:

1. **YAML frontmatter** — metadata about the conversation
2. **Markdown body** — the actual conversation content

## Frontmatter Fields

The frontmatter sits between `---` delimiters at the top of the output:

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `ctxport` | Format version | `v2` |
| `source` | Platform the conversation came from | `chatgpt`, `claude`, `gemini`, `deepseek`, `grok`, `github` |
| `url` | Original conversation URL | `https://chatgpt.com/c/abc123` |
| `title` | Conversation title | `Debug React Hook` |
| `date` | When the conversation was copied (ISO 8601) | `2025-01-15T10:30:00Z` |
| `nodes` | Number of messages in the conversation | `12` |
| `format` | Copy format used | `full`, `user-only`, `code-only`, `compact` |

## Body Format

The conversation body uses `## User` and `## Assistant` headings to separate messages. All original Markdown formatting — code blocks, lists, bold, links — is preserved.

## User

I'm getting a TypeScript error: "Property 'name' does not exist on type '{}'".
Here's my code:

\```typescript
const user = {};
console.log(user.name);
\```

## Assistant

The error occurs because TypeScript infers the type of `user` as `{}` (empty object), which has no properties. You need to define a type:

\```typescript
interface User {
  name: string;
}

const user: User = { name: "Alice" };
console.log(user.name);
\```

## User

That fixed it, thanks! What if the name is optional?

## Assistant

Use a question mark to make the property optional:

\```typescript
interface User {
  name?: string;
}

const user: User = {};
console.log(user.name); // undefined, but no error
\```
```

## Why This Format?

**Human-readable.** It's just Markdown. Open it in any text editor, note app, or documentation tool and it looks good.

**Machine-readable.** The YAML frontmatter makes it easy for scripts and AI tools to parse the metadata — source, date, message count — without regex hacks.

**Git-friendly.** Context Bundles are plain text. Store them in a git repo, diff them, search them with grep. They work with every tool in the developer ecosystem.

**AI-portable.** Paste a Context Bundle into any AI assistant and it immediately understands the conversation structure. The `## User` / `## Assistant` headings match how most AI tools think about conversations.
