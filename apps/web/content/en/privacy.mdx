# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: February 7, 2026**

## The Short Version

CtxPort does **not** collect, store, or transmit any user data. Period.

## Data Collection

CtxPort collects **zero** user data. There are:

- No analytics
- No tracking
- No cookies
- No telemetry
- No user accounts
- No data sent to any server

All conversation processing happens **100% locally** in your browser. Your conversations never leave your machine.

## Extension Permissions

CtxPort requests a minimal set of browser permissions. Here's what each one does and why it's needed:

| Permission | Why It's Needed |
|---|---|
| `activeTab` | Access the current tab to extract conversation content when you click copy |
| `storage` | Store your preferences (copy format, theme, etc.) locally in your browser |
| `host_permissions` for supported AI sites | Required to inject copy buttons and read conversation DOM on ChatGPT, Claude, and other supported platforms |

These permissions are the minimum required for CtxPort to function. No permission is used for data collection.

## Open Source

CtxPort is fully open source under the [MIT license](https://github.com/nicepkg/ctxport). Anyone can audit the source code to verify that no data collection occurs.

## Third-Party Services

CtxPort does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or data collection services. The CtxPort website is hosted on Cloudflare for content delivery only.

## Children's Privacy

CtxPort does not knowingly collect any personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated revision date. Since CtxPort collects no data, changes are unlikely to be material.
