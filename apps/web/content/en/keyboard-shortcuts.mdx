# Keyboard Shortcuts

CtxPort supports keyboard shortcuts so you can copy conversations without touching the mouse.

## Default Shortcut

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **Alt+Shift+C** | Copy the current conversation |

This works on all supported platforms. The conversation is copied using your currently selected format.

## Customize the Shortcut

Chrome lets you change extension keyboard shortcuts:

1. Open `chrome://extensions/shortcuts` in your browser
2. Find **CtxPort** in the list
3. Click the pencil icon next to the shortcut you want to change
4. Press your desired key combination
5. The new shortcut takes effect immediately

### Tips

- Choose a combination that doesn't conflict with the website's own shortcuts or your system shortcuts
- On macOS, **Alt** is the **Option** key
- If the shortcut doesn't work on a specific site, the site may be capturing that key combination. Try a different one.
