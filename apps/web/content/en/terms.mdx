# Terms of Service

**Last updated: February 7, 2026**

## Overview

CtxPort is open source software licensed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/nicepkg/ctxport/blob/main/LICENSE). By using CtxPort, you agree to the following terms.

## License

CtxPort is provided under the MIT license. You are free to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the software, subject to the conditions of the MIT license.

## Disclaimer of Warranty

CtxPort is provided **"as is"**, without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and noninfringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from the use of the software.

## Your Responsibilities

- **Platform compliance**: You are responsible for complying with the terms of service of the AI platforms you use (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.). CtxPort is a tool that reads publicly displayed conversation content from your own sessions — but you should ensure your use complies with each platform's policies.
- **Lawful use**: Do not use CtxPort for any illegal or unauthorized purpose.
- **Content ownership**: CtxPort copies conversations that you have access to. You are responsible for how you use and share the copied content.

## Limitations

- CtxPort operates entirely within your browser and has no server-side component. We cannot control, monitor, or take responsibility for how you use the copied content.
- CtxPort depends on the DOM structure of third-party websites. We cannot guarantee uninterrupted functionality if those websites change their structure.

## Changes to These Terms

We may update these terms from time to time. Changes will be reflected on this page with an updated revision date. Continued use of CtxPort after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.
